Quick Sort
- Pivot and smaller go to left
- Larger go to right

When to use sorting
-Insertion sort
    - only few items and mostly sorted
-Bubble sort
    - for education only not very efficient
-Selection sort
    - for education only not very efficient
-Merge sort
    - for most case
    - Divide and Conqour O(n log (n))
    - use O(n) space complexity
-Quick sort
    - less complexity O(log (n))
    - if you pick wrong pivot it can be O(n^2) => pivot is smallest or largest
